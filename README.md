# My Full Life

My Full Life is a web-based application focused on promoting continuous self-improvement and independent living for individuals living with disabilities. While feature-rich and useful to mentors, certain accessibility and engagement barriers have prevented some users in the disabled community from using the site to its fullest potential. This paper discusses our research and prototyping efforts towards the enhancement of My Full Life via the guidance of principles such as universal design and an increased emphasis on community-building and gamification.
